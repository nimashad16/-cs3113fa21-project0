2) In order to run our program using our testing file, we must first open the directory of the file in the terminal. first you create an "input.txt" file so that we can test the characters in it. We then use touch to input text into the file. Next we use the make all function in the make file in order to compile our project.We can then use the cat function to do cat input.txt |./project0 in order to run our txt file into our project to get our outputs. After this use the make clean functoin to get rid of any processes or directories that may have been created.



3) Bugs: Going into this project I was utterly confused on how I could even make this project work. Learning the new syntax as well as such difficult concept really put a strain on me. I think one of the first bugs I encountered was wasting my time trying to get character inputs and convert them to binary. it wasnt until I was told later that they would already be read in as binaries that I had to switch my code. i could go on an extensive list about the minor bugs I was encountering but I think another one I had was that it was outputting one extra line in my test cases which was causing me to get points deducted. learning how to allocate memory and other info in the sort caused quite a few problems.
