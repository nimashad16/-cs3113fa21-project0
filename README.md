3) Bugs: Going into this project I was utterly confused on how I could even make this project work. Learning the new syntax as well as such difficult concept really put a strain on me. I think one of the first bugs I encountered was wasting my time trying to get character inputs and convert them to binary. it wasnt until I was told later that they would already be read in as binaries that I had to switch my code. i could go on an extensive list about the minor bugs I was encountering but I think another one I had was that it was outputting one extra line in my test cases which was causing me to get points deducted. learning how to allocate memory and other info in the sort caused quite a few problems.
